From the Bhagavad Gita, a name that encapsulates qualities of purity, beauty, and cleanliness is "Sattva" (सत्त्व). In Hindu philosophy, particularly within the context of the Bhagavad Gita, "Sattva" refers to one of the three Gunas (qualities or attributes of nature), representing purity, harmony, balance, and goodness. It's associated with clarity, wisdom, and peace, embodying the essence of what is considered beautiful and clean in both a spiritual and physical sense.

The aim of this project is to score a software in terms of quality, cleanliness and beauty.
